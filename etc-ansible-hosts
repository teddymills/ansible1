# /etc/ansible/hosts

# Once ansible is installed, replace the default /etc/ansible/hosts with this
# I did not know what the public or private ips of the VMs would be.

# A user account with sudo access will need to be created and enabled
# with password=Blue7070, because root is not allowed ssh access by default
# on Ubuntu (it can be forced if needed)

# Only a single group, in this case wordpress is required because every
# host in wordpress group will get mysql-server installed on it because
# mysql-server is required by wordpress. A single database could be used by
# all wordpress sites...but that was not required here.
